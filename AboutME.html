  <div class= "Text-left"> Hello My name is Clayton Forbes, I am  a Computer Programmer who studied at Fanshawe college and has some self taught experience.
    I am originally from The Bahamas where I obtain my Associate Degree in Computer Science at Bahamas Technical Vocational Institute, otherwise known as BTVI.
    From there I took a programming class and devevloping a simple website for a project using HTML and CSS. At first I only saw it as a project, something to get 
    an A but , in developing the webpage it turn out to be more then I had imagine. As most people when they first see a movie with some form of hacking or programing they think "Wow thats cool I want to do that". 
   How do I know this well because, well I was one of them, but unlike most I wanted to learn more. So I went on youtube, and with not much knowledege of the programming I came across a video.
   <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-VKC8g2u1Y&t=165s">How to become a good programmer</a></li> This six minute video inspired me in many ways to become a Computer programmer an in it spark my imagination to become a great one.
   You may be wondering with the matrix theme why the wolf. For me wolves are my favorite animals on land amoung others. Like programmers in busineness or corroprations they travel or work in packs.
   I like to compare programmers to wolves because of the community in which both groups. Programmers as a collective group work on projects to create amazing Applications, while
   wolves work together to hunt and survive. I am a beginner at programmer with some experience in Computer Science, but a hard worker and a resercher. Almost everything you need is online and can be learn though a little time and study.
   I am a lone wolf, that left his pack(college/home) and want to build and join onto another pack your company if presented the oppourtonity, because with a pack I can learn and gain experience from other senior programmers to better me in my journey as a programmer.
